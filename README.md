# Vick_help - SoloLearn Project

Create a project that does the following:

(Total Sales) A company has four salespeople (1 to 4) who sell five different products (1 to 5).
Once a day, each salesperson passes in a slip for each different type of product sold.

Each slip contains the following:
  a) The salesperson's number
  b) The product number
  c) The total Birr value of that product sold that day 
  
Thus, each salesperson passes in between 0 and 5 sales slips per day.

The program records the above daily information and generates a summary of the total sales by each salesperson per product.

At the end of every month, the program prints the results in tabular format with each of the columns representing a particular salesperson
and each of the rows representing a particular product.

  Cross total each row to get the total sales of each product for last month;
  cross total each column to get the total sales by salesperson for last month.

Your tabular printout should include these cross totals to the right of the totaled rows and the bottom of the totaled columns.

Also, the company wants the program to calculate the bonus payment each salesperson receives at the end of the month
and print it at the bottom of the column. 

The company pays a 5% bonus to each of its salespeople based on the number of sales he/she made during the previous month.

Using the information given here write an application to solve the problem of the company.

Also, the program allows searching for a particular product or salesperson record.
